Ewing sarcoma research runs on a small number of immortalized **cell-line models** (A673, SK-ES-1, RD-ES, TC-71, TC-32, SK-N-MC, EW8, CHLA-9/10/25, and roughly two dozen others). These models, and the open genomic/functional-genomic data generated on them, are scattered across several public resources — the **Cancer Dependency Map (DepMap)** and the legacy **Cancer Cell Line Encyclopedia (CCLE)** at the Broad Institute, the **Cell Model Passports** at the Wellcome Sanger Institute, **Cellosaurus** at the SIB, and the **ICLAC Register of Misidentified Cell Lines**. No single, source-verified, machine-readable place tells a researcher, for one Ewing model: *is it authenticated, is it on the misidentified register, what fusion does it carry and at what breakpoint, what open omics and functional-genomics data exist for it, and what selective genetic dependencies do the open CRISPR screens report* — each assertion carried with its provenance and license.

**Definition of shipped:** the open-data/license/privacy gate (artifact committed); identity is resolved across the three core systems; authentication/misidentification status is present; all assertions are field-level provenanced; the completeness score is ≥ 90/100; the entry validates in CI; the domain r
